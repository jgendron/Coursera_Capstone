### 1. Introduction

This report provides background, results, and discussion of the Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The focus of the project was to identify a project focus, extract data from commercial sources, conduct a cluster analysis of various neighborhoods to determine which are similar, and report on the results in report and blog format.

#### 1.1 Background

Norfolk, Virginia lies on the east coast of the United States. Virgina sits in the Mid-Atlantic Region with its northern neighbors like Washington, D.C. and its neighbors to the south like the Carolinas. The town of Norfolk began in the late 17th century, soon after providing protection in Fort Norfolk and becoming home to shipyards for the U.S. Navy. Norfolk became a city in the 18th century and with it a number of present-day neighborhoods - like Ghent, the Freemason District, and Larchmont - began to come to life.

Norfolk exists in a region called Hampton Roads (formerly the Tidewater Region). It is neighbors to cities like Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth. Citizens all coexist in Hampton Roads. They often live in one city and work in another. Nonetheless, there is a persistant rivalry among the cities when it comes to attractions, food, and beverage offerings. This analysis characterizes the neighborhoods of Norfolk and compares them for similarity not only among themselves but also with key neighborhoods from the neighboring cities.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement

How do the attractions, food, and beverages offered in Norfolk cluster within the city? How similer are key neighborhoods of Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth to Norfolk and which neighborhoods do they emulate most?

#### 1.3 Motivation

A key economic driver of the Hampton Roads area is tourism and restauranteurs. Those small business owners and entrpreneurs engaged in the Norfolk area may find a similarity analysis useful in determing a location and branding for their new restaurant or watering hole.

## 2. Data

A critical element of this analysis is fusing together necessary data from multiple sources. The two primary sources of data are Wikipedia and the Foursquare API (Application Programming Interface)

#### 2.1 Wikipedia

Norfolk and its neighboring cities are of medium size with populations under 500,000 people. Each city, however, consists of many neighborhoods each having its own name and character. Wikipedia provided a comprehensive listing of Norfolk neighboorhoods [reference: Wikipedia listing of Norfolk neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Norfolk,_Virginia). Those interested in looking at neighborhoods in the other cities can use these results from Google search engine banners:

#### 2.2 Foursquare API

During the course, students interacted with the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). It is a rich source of geo-location data that enables developers to identify venues in an area identified by a latitude and longitude. The API also allows exploration of venues near venues idenified as well as the categories of the venues. The figure below shows an example of Foursquare data extracted into a pandas dataframe during the course exercise of clustering Toronto neighborhoods.
